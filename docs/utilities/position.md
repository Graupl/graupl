| `$use-important` | Appends `!important` to generated utility declarations. | `true` |
| `$generate-base-utilities` | Generates the base utility classes. | `true` |
| `$screen-aware` | Enables screen-aware utility variants. | `false` |

| `$scheme-aware-selector-suffix` | Suffix to the scheme-aware portion of utility selectors. | `"-mode"` |
| `$scheme-aware-selector-separator` | Separator inserted for scheme-aware utility selectors. | `"\\:"` |
| `$state-aware-selector-prefix` | Prefix to the state-aware portion of utility selectors. | `""` |
| `$state-aware-selector-suffix` | Suffix to the state-aware portion of utility selectors. | `""` |

## Responsive Variants

Generating responsive utility classes can be done by setting `$screen-aware`, `$theme-aware`, `$scheme-aware`, `$state-aware`, or `$container-aware` to `true`.

By default, screen-aware responsive utility classes are generated for position.
